# CSach: My Custom Programming Language

Welcome to the repository of my custom programming language! This project is a personal endeavor to learn and explore the C programming language (hence the name is C + Sach) by developing a new programming language from scratch. Inspired by [Ianertson's YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@helloworldcode), this project serves a way for me to learn C in a creative way.

## Introduction

This project is designed to help me (and potentially others) learn the fundamentals of the C programming language by building a new programming language. It provides a hands-on approach to understanding compiler design, syntax parsing, and other core concepts of programming languages.

## Features

- **Variable Declaration and Printing**: Currently, you can create variables and print their values.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a C compiler installed (e.g., ```gcc```, ```clang```).
- You have ```make``` installed.

### Usage

Due to this project being in its early stages, steps are currently not provided to install and run this programming language. \
This will be completed soon.

## Examples

Here's an example of how to use the current features:

```
let name = "Sachkeerat Singh Brar";
print(name);
```
